Hello All, with the help of create.withcode.uk, i was able to implement a python based code editor.



create.withcode.uk lets you write, run, debug and share python code in a web browser.

## Features:
* Write python code with syntax highlighting
* Run python code in a web browser
* No user accounts needed
* Completely free
* Includes micro:bit python simulator
* Includes Raspberry Pi GPIO python simulator

It's designed for students and teachers learning or experimenting with python code.

This github repro includes most of the source code for create.withcode.uk so that it will run without needing to be hosted on a webserver. It doesn't include the code to be able to save or share python code.
